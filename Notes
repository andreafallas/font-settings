page1.html

	hide_show_btn needs a pointer applied to it when the user mouses over the link.
	I also want the text to fade. There are several options here:
	1. Split "Hide instructions" and "Show instructions" into separate elements. Then hide/display these elements using fade-in and fade-out.
	2. Figure out a way to crossfade the text within the current element using JS.

	The control buttons are not working properly. At the moment, the page requires s#link to be appended to work correcty.

	I want to try and wrap the page in the Bootstrap layout to simplify the styles.

	The form needs sorting out.
	It will need to send the follwing information:
	* unique identifier - we need a way to ensure the responses belong to a singe session/user go
	* font-family - to tell whether the user has selected serif or sans
	* font-size - the size of font displayed when the user submits the form
	* device / browser - so we can tell what device a user is using
