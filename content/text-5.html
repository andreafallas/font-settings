    <p>
      There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy
      wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any
      shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl,
      or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an
      old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her
      castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and
      set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never
      to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she
      was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her
      up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages
      hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than
      all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose
      name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married.
      One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and
      Jorindel said, 'We must take care that we don't go too near to the fairy's
      castle.' It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun
      shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood
      beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both
      felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted
      from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they
      looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a
      loss to know what path to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind
      the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the
      bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old
      walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
      Jorinda was just singing,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 'The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,
  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
  He mourn'd for the fate of his darling mate,
  Well-a-day!'
</pre>
    <p>
      when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and
      beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with
      a mournful <i>jug, jug</i>. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round
      them, and three times screamed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 'Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!'
</pre>
    <p>
      Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither
      weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;
      the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the
      old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and
      chin that almost met one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away
      with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone&mdash;but
      what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot
      where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 'Till the prisoner is fast,
  And her doom is cast,
  There stay! Oh, stay!
  When the charm is around her,
  And the spell has bound her,
  Hie away! away!'
</pre>
    <p>
      On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before
      the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she
      laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. 'Alas!' he said, 'what
      will become of me?' He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a
      strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he
      walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all
      in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and
      that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked
      the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that
      everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found
      his Jorinda again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for
      this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on
      the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower;
      and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl.
      Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till
      he came again to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become
      fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.
      Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with
      the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and
      listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the
      chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the
      seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and
      screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for
      the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the
      birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should
      he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he
      saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of
      her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage
      with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round
      his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked
      together in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took
      their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married,
      and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads,
      whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy's cages by
      themselves, much longer than they liked.

    <h2>
      THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS
    </h2>
    <p>
      An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a
      great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more
      unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to
      think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief
      was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the
      great city, 'For there,' thought he, 'I may turn musician.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the roadside
      and panting as if he were tired. 'What makes you pant so, my friend?' said
      the ass. 'Alas!' said the dog, 'my master was going to knock me on the
      head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to
      him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?'
      'Hark ye!' said the ass, 'I am going to the great city to turn musician:
      suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?' The dog
      said he was willing, and they jogged on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the
      road and making a most rueful face. 'Pray, my good lady,' said the ass,
      'what's the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!' 'Ah, me!'
      said the cat, 'how can one be in good spirits when one's life is in
      danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease
      by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold
      of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to
      get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.' 'Oh,' said the
      ass, 'by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night
      singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.' The cat was pleased with
      the thought, and joined the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock
      perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.
      'Bravo!' said the ass; 'upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what
      is all this about?' 'Why,' said the cock, 'I was just now saying that we
      should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the
      cook don't thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head
      tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!'
      'Heaven forbid!' said the ass, 'come with us Master Chanticleer; it will
      be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off!
      Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of
      a concert; so come along with us.' 'With all my heart,' said the cock: so
      they all four went on jollily together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night
      came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid
      themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the
      branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he
      should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his
      custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see
      that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something bright
      and shining and calling to his companions said, 'There must be a house no
      great way off, for I see a light.' 'If that be the case,' said the ass,
      'we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the
      world!' 'Besides,' added the dog, 'I should not be the worse for a bone or
      two, or a bit of meat.' So they walked off together towards the spot where
      Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and
      brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of
      robbers lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and
      peeped in. 'Well, Donkey,' said Chanticleer, 'what do you see?' 'What do I
      see?' replied the ass. 'Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good
      things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.' 'That would be a noble
      lodging for us,' said the cock. 'Yes,' said the ass, 'if we could only get
      in'; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the
      robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed himself
      upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window;
      the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog's shoulders,
      and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat's head. When all was ready a
      signal was given, and they began their music. The ass brayed, the dog
      barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke
      through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the
      broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a
      little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some
      frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as
      they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the
      robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to
      eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put
      out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own
      liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the
      dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself
      up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam
      on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their
      journey, they soon fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were
      out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in
      too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the
      rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he marched
      into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light
      a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he
      mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. But
      the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and
      scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the
      back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he
      was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been
      awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the robber ran
      back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a
      horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his
      face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had
      hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black
      monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil
      had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, 'Throw the rascal up
      here!' After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the
      musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their
      abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.

    <h2>
      OLD SULTAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and
      had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife were
      standing together before the house the shepherd said, 'I will shoot old
      Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.' But his wife said,
      'Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great
      many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his
      days.' 'But what can we do with him?' said the shepherd, 'he has not a
      tooth in his head, and the thieves don't care for him at all; to be sure
      he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow
      shall be his last day, depend upon it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and
      his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
      tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
      friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and
      how his master meant to kill him in the morning. 'Make yourself easy,'
      said the wolf, 'I will give you some good advice. Your master, you know,
      goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they
      take their little child with them, and lay it down behind the hedge in the
      shade while they are at work. Now do you lie down close by the child, and
      pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away
      with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop;
      then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their
      child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as
      long as you live.' The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so
      it was managed. The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and
      his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor
      little thing back to his master and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him
      on the head, and said, 'Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and
      therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat.
      Wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion
      to sleep on as long as he lives.' So from this time forward Sultan had all
      that he could wish for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, 'Now, my good
      fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when I
      want to taste one of the old shepherd's fine fat sheep.' 'No,' said the
      Sultan; 'I will be true to my master.' However, the wolf thought he was in
      joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But Sultan had told his
      master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn
      door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had
      a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan 'an old rogue,' and swore
      he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to
      challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now Sultan had
      nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd's old three-legged
      cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some
      trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied
      their enemies coming, and saw the cat's long tail standing straight in the
      air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and
      every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at
      them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar
      lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree. Sultan and the
      cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there. The
      boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the
      bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something
      move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched
      it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out,
      'Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.' So they looked
      up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him
      a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was
      heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again
      with old Sultan.
