    <p>
      In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of
      beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that
      it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When
      she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing
      it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning
      coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said:
      'Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: 'I
      fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer
      force, my death would have been certain,&mdash;I should have been burnt to
      ashes.' The bean said: 'I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the
      old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth
      without any mercy, like my comrades.' 'And would a better fate have fallen
      to my lot?' said the straw. 'The old woman has destroyed all my brethren
      in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives.
      I luckily slipped through her fingers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what are we to do now?' said the coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think,' answered the bean, 'that as we have so fortunately escaped
      death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
      mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair
      to a foreign country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
      together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no
      bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The
      straw hit on a good idea, and said: 'I will lay myself straight across,
      and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.' The straw therefore
      stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an
      impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge.
      But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath
      her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.
      The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the
      stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water,
      and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the
      shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed
      so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her,
      likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of
      work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate
      heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The
      bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all
      beans since then have a black seam.

    <h2>
      BRIAR ROSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,
      where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had plenty
      of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to
      eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had
      been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very
      much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the
      river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had
      thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the
      bank. Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again
      into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the
      water and said, 'I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in
      return for your kindness to me&mdash;you will soon have a daughter.' What
      the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little
      girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for
      joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the
      child to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends,
      and neighbours. But the queen said, 'I will have the fairies also, that
      they might be kind and good to our little daughter.' Now there were
      thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve
      golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the
      fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red
      cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long
      white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round
      in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave
      her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all
      that was good in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in
      the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come,
      with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a
      broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.
      Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and
      scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge.
      So she cried out, 'The king's daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be
      wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.' Then the twelfth of the
      friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said
      that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its
      mischief; so her gift was, that the king's daughter, when the spindle
      wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a
      hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the
      threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should
      be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were
      in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and well
      behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and
      queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved
      about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last
      she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending
      with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she
      turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away
      very busily. 'Why, how now, good mother,' said the princess; 'what are you
      doing there?' 'Spinning,' said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming
      a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. 'How prettily that little thing turns
      round!' said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin.
      But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy's prophecy was
      fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the
      king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell
      asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the
      court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the
      walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep;
      the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it
      for the king's dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment
      pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for
      something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler,
      who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and
      thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it
      became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and
      hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there
      went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose
      (for so the king's daughter was called): so that, from time to time,
      several kings' sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the
      palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and
      bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck
      fast, and died wretchedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many, many years there came a king's son into that land: and an old
      man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful
      palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,
      lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from
      his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break
      through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died.
      Then the young prince said, 'All this shall not frighten me; I will go and
      see this Briar Rose.' The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent
      upon going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to
      the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which
      he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he
      came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep;
      and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the
      pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came
      into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was
      standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink
      a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and
      the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going
      to beat the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear
      every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened
      the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,
      fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he
      could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
      But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled
      upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also
      awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. And
      the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the
      pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew
      into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the
      kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the
      goose for the king's dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of
      ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box
      on his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was
      given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.
