					<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
					and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her
					sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what 
					is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p>
					<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot 
					day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a 
					daisy- chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, 
					when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
					<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so 
					very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! 
					I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her 
					that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite 
					natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, 
					and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it 
					flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a 
					waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, 
					she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it 
					pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
